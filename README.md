# Load-and-Preprocessing-Images-Paired-With-Image-Classification-ML-Model
This file uses three different methods of loading and preprocessing images using TensorFlow. Paired with this loading and preprocessing practice is a 10 layer  Convolutional Neural Network designed for image classification. I learned how to create this model using TensorFlow tutorials.
